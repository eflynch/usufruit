Usage: node scripts/seed-books.js <libraryId> <librarianId> [count]

Arguments:
  libraryId    - ID of the library to add books to
  librarianId  - ID of the librarian who will own the books
  count        - Number of books to create (default: 20)

Examples:
  node scripts/seed-books.js lib-123 librarian-456
  node scripts/seed-books.js lib-123 librarian-456 50
  node scripts/seed-books.js lib-123 librarian-456 100

This script will create realistic sample books perfect for testing 
pagination and search functionality.
